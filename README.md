Coding Challenge for Rush Partners (https://github.com/rushpartners/frontend-coding-challenge)


## Details

Here is my submission for the coding challenge.

It's written in `typescript` and I decided to go with `react-static` which runs the dev environment as well as being able to generate a static build for production.

I used `styled-components` for the site styles as I'm a big fan of the css-in-js approach, and I used my own `react-grid-flexbox` package to render the pitch and various formations.

The project also includes tests written with `jest` and `enzyme`, but the tests are pretty basic and there is definitely room for improvement.


## Installation

1) Clone the repo

2) `npm install` or `yarn`

3) `npm run start` or `yarn start` to run dev server


## Hosting

As an extra little bonus I also got the project hosted on firebase (https://team-lineups.firebaseapp.com)
